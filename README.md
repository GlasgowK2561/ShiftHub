### Creating a schedule
The general manager of the business will be the main user for this application. The general manager can hire/fire employees, create departments, and create schedules. When the manager creates a department, a "default" schedule will be created for a normal week. This can be edited at any time. This default schedule allows for the scheduler to create the weekly schedule seamlessly using the employees availablility from our database. When the manager creates the weekly schedule, the scheduler will create a schedule for each department and send the schedule straight to the employee.

### Adding an Employee
When an employee is hired, the manager can add their information, and then hire them for a specific department. This allows for the employee to be added to the weekly schedule for that department. Once the employee has been fully hired on, they are now able to be scheduled on their departments schedule.

### Distributing the schedule
Whenever a manager creates or edits a schedule, the application will either email or text the schedule to the employees. This allows for the employee to have their schedule available at all times.
